                    Action shooting is the practice of shooting at multiple targets, moving targets, targets that react when hit, penalty targets mixed-in, obstacle movement, and competitive tactics.
                    It includes IPSC, IDPA, ICORE, USPSA and cowboy action<br /><br />
                    Action shooting uses only full pistol power (9 mm and above).

                <h2>IPSC - International Practical Shooting Confederation</h2>
                <p>
                    IPSC athletes need to blend accuracy, power, and speed into a winning combination. Multiple targets, moving targets, targets that react when hit, penalty targets, or even partially covered targets, obstacles, movement, competitive strategies, and other techniques are all a part of IPSC to keep competitors challenged and spectators engaged.

                <h2>IDPA - International Defensive Pistol Association </h2>
                <p>
                    IDPA is the use of practical equipment including full charge service ammunition to solve simulated real world self-defense scenarios using practical handguns and holsters that are suitable for self-defense use. The main goal is to test the skill and ability of an individual.

                <h2>ICORE - International Confederation of Revolver Enthusiasts</h2>
                <p>
                    ICORE combines elements of the Bianchi Cup, IPSC, and the Steel Challenge into demanding competition exclusively for revolvers. Scoring is based on time, including time added or subtracted per the ICORE scoring rules for shots fired at NRA D-1 targets. Falling and stationary steel plates can also be used in ICORE events.
