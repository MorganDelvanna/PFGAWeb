         <p>This is a year round function as it can be shot both indoors and outdoors. Our indoor range has practice butts that we shoot up to 20 yards. The outdoor range features 3-D animal targets placed along a marked course and are shot at various distances to sharpen your archery skills. </p>
            
            <p>Shooting our outdoor range may be done any day with you being the judge of weather and conditions. </p>

            <p>We do allow crossbows but not broad-heads due to the damage they cause to the targets.</p>
