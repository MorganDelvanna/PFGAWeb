                                        Competition Event Rules will take precedent over General

                                    <li>	Shooters may move closer to targets to shoot at lesser distances (if other shooters are absent, or if they are permitted to do so by other shooters present).  Shooters can NOT move targets to other, unsanctioned distances, from firing lines.  Note:  This point ties into the ‘target placement’ issue raised by Larry… it shall be referred to Rules Committee for further consideration</li>
