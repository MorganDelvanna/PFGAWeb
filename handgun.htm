        <p>The PF&GA range is ideally suited for recreational shooting as well as handgun competition. The range is equipped for the various handgun events shot in Olympic and International competitions. </p>
        <p>Bulls-eye, “The Gallery” and Canadian 900, the events most often fired by PFGA shooters, offer a pleasing assortment of slow and deliberate shooting as well as faster, more instinctive shooting. </p>
        <p>Shooting is not easy, but the fact that it is challenging to master adds to the appeal. </p>
        <br />
        <div class="Heading2">Action Shooting</div>
        <p>A new section has been added to PF&GA’s handgun roster.</p> 
        <p>Action shooting is the practice of shooting at multiple targets, moving targets, targets that react when hit, penalty targets mixed-in, obstacle movement, and competitive tactics. 
            It includes IPSC, IDPA, ICORE, USPSA and cowboy action</p>
        <p>Action shooting uses only full pistol power (9 mm and above).</p>
