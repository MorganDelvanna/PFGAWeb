                <h2>Handgun</h2>
                <p>The PF&GA range is ideally suited for recreational shooting as well as handgun competition. The range is equipped for the various handgun events shot in Olympic and International competitions. </p>
                <p>Bulls-eye, "The Gallery" and Canadian 900, the events most often fired by PFGA shooters, offer a pleasing assortment of slow and deliberate shooting as well as faster, more instinctive shooting. </p>
                <p>Shooting is not easy, but the fact that it is challenging to master adds to the appeal. </p>

                <p>Action shooting uses only full pistol power (9 mm and above).</p>
